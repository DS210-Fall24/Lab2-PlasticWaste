Plastic pollution is a major and growing problem, negatively affecting oceans and wildlife health. [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution) has a lot of great data at various levels including globally, per country, and over time. For this lab we focus on data from 2010.

Additionally, National Geographic recently ran a data visualization communication contest on plastic waste as seen [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/funding-opportunities/innovation-challenges/plastic/dataviz/).

Learning goals for this lab are:

- Visualize numerical and categorical data.
- Recreate visualizations.
- Get more practice using R Studio with Git and GitHub.

## Getting started

Click on the link emailed to you to create your Lab 02 repo, which should be named `lab-02-plastic-waste-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`. Copy the URL of the repo, and use it to create an RStudio project. Refer to Lab 01 if you would like to see step-by-step instructions for cloning a repo into an RStudio project.

First, open the R Markdown document `lab-02-plastic-waste.Rmd`.

This document uses the `emo` package.  If you have not done so previously, you will need to install this package by running the following commands in the **Console**:
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
```


### Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for this analysis:

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## The data

The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file in the `data` folder of your repository. You can read it in using the following.

```{r load-data, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

The variable descriptions are as follows:

- `code`: 3 Letter country code
- `entity`: Country name
- `continent`: Continent name
- `year`: Year
- `gdp_per_cap`: GDP per capita constant 2011 international $, rate
- `plastic_waste_per_cap`: Daily plastic waste generation per capita, measured in kg per person per day
- `mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap`: Amount of mismanaged plastic waste (littered or improperly disposed) per capita, measured in kg per person per day
- `mismanaged_plastic_waste`: Tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste
- `coastal_pop`: Number of individuals living on/near coast
- `total_pop`: Total population according to Gapminder

## Exercises


1.  View the data using the `glimpse()` function.  What does each row represent?

2.  Examine the structure of the dataset:  How many columns and observations (rows) does the dataset have? Instead of hard coding the number in your answer, use inline code.



Let's start exploring the data by taking a look at the distribution of plastic waste per capita in 2010:

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-hist, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = "light blue")
```

One country stands out as an unusual observation at the top of the distribution. One way of identifying this country is to filter the data for countries where plastic waste per capita is greater than 3.5 kg/person per day.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-max, eval=TRUE}
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```

Did you expect this result? Later, you might consider doing some research on Trinidad and Tobago to see why plastic waste per capita is so high there, or whether this is a data error.

**From this point onwards the plots / output of the code won't be evaluated or printed in the lab html file, but you can run the code and view the results in the html by setting eval = TRUE in the R chunk option.**

3. Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent.


4.  Next, use box plots to compare the distribution of plastic waster per capita by continent.  Below is some code to filter the data to exclude the high outlier. Use this filtered dataset, `plastic_waste_filtered`, for your box plots.  (If you are curious, try constructing your box plots using the unfiltered dataset and see how they look!)   What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita?  Use correct statistical terminology in your response, and be sure to address the shape, center, and spread of the distributions.

```{r filter-plastic-waste, eval = FALSE}
plastic_waste_filtered <- plastic_waste %>% 
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3.5)
```

5. Convert your side-by-side box plots to violin plots.  Make the violin plot for each continent a different color.  What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots?

6.  Another way of visualizing numerical data is using density plots:

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_filtered, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_density()
```

We can compare distributions across continents by coloring density curves by continent:

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_filtered, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The resulting plot may be a little difficult to read, so let's also fill the curves in with color:

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_filtered, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density()
```

The overlapping colors make it difficult to tell what's happening with the distributions for each continent since they are plotted on top of each other. We can change the transparency level of the fill color to help with this. The `alpha` argument takes values between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely transparent and 1 is completely opaque. There is no way to tell what value will work best, so you just need to try a few.

```{r plastic_waste_per_cap-dens-color-fill-alpha, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste_filtered, 
       mapping = aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
                     color = continent, 
                     fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)
```

This still doesn't look great...

Recreate the density plots above using a different (lower) alpha level that works better for displaying the density curves for all continents.

7. Describe why we defined the `color` and `fill` of the curves by mapping aesthetics of the plot but we defined the `alpha` level as a characteristic of the plotting geom.

8. Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita for the filtered dataset using a scatterplot. Describe the relationship.

9. Color the points in the scatterplot by continent. Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated?

10. Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic waste per capita and coastal population for the filtered dataset (you should have two separate plots). Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated?  You might consider adding `geom_smooth()` as a layer to your plots to help visualize the relationships.

11. Recreate the plot below, and interpret what you see in context of the data.  The x-axis is a calculated variable and the one country with plastic waste per capita over 3 kg/day has been filtered out.  I have completed the filtering step for you in the starter code below.  (We will learn about creating new variables and filtering data in the next unit.)  Note:  you do not have to specify a dataset in the ggplot command (the way the code is written, the filtered dataset will be passed to the ggplot function). The data in the graph below are not only represented with points on the plot, but also with a smooth curve. The term “smooth” should help you pick which geom to use.  See the `ggplot` reference link on Brightspace under Content -> Resources.  The colors are from the viridis color palette.  Search the functions starting with `scale_color_viridis_*` for more information.  You should use the function `scale_color_viridis_d()` as a layer in your graph to display the points using a discrete color scale.  The plot also uses `theme_minimal()`, which should be added as a layer to the plot.    

```{r eval = FALSE}
plastic_waste %>% 
  mutate(coastal_pop_prop = coastal_pop / total_pop) %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap < 3) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = coastal_pop_prop, ...))
# You fill in the rest
```

```{r paste-graphic, echo = FALSE, fig.width=5, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("data/Graph.png")
```
